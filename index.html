                <img src="https://ya-webdesign.com/images/arthur-transparent.png">
                <p>Arthur is in 3rd grade, tackling problems with his friends and himself.  He is the wholesome one of the group (at least heâ€™s portrayed as that). His full name is Arthur Timothy Read, and he is meant to be a sort of "everykid." That is, every child can relate to his frustrations, hopes, successes, and failures. The most important thing about Arthur is that he actively explores the world around him.</p>

            <div class="agento">
                <h1>Agent Olympia (Odd Squad)</h1>

                <p>Olympia is very energetic and friendly. She loves working, but she also enjoys having fun and usually has an optimistic outlook on life. She loves to help others and whenever she sees that someone is upset, she does her best to cheer them up. She has the habit of acting like a workaholic, she treats her job seriously and with dignity, but also an obsession. She is also very organized and somewhat disgusted by disorganization.

                <img src="https://ya-webdesign.com/images/stuck-clip-martha-speaks-15.png">
                <p>She is outspoken, honest, loyal, kind, and very talkative! Although she is bilingual (speaking human and dog), she sees the world from a dog's point of view. She can also translate what most other animals are saying.</p>
